        This was a hackathon project I made with some friends and it is a full stack web application where you can log users in and check for upcoming medications. The UI was made in Vue.js and it uses a backend in flask to fetch data from the SQL database. In addition, it also makes use of the OpenFDA database where it fetches all the drug info and dosage data for a singular medication.

        This is a smaller mini challenge application I made which scrapes data from billwurtz.com and created a search function that is able to parse the html and post it as the output. The project was done in flask and the web scraping was done with beutifulsoup.

        This is a demonstration of an old scikit learn model I developed back in high school and it analyzes different xray images of Pneumonia and non Pneumonia patients. The new demonstration was made in pytorch in two ways one with a model from scratch and the other with a pretrained resnet15 model.

        This is an embedded systems project where it mimics a car security system. I used magnetic reed switches to read if the door has been opened or not and I used a breadboard with LEDs to flash the light if it was unwantedly opened. If it was not intentionally opened, it would sound a loud alarm and it begins to track the location of the cars whereabouts. The security was programmed using an arduino and a NEO6M GPS module for tracking the car in C++.

        This project kinda started it all. I was bored during the pandemic and decided to elaborate on a project that I developed in a hackathon that year. It it an incremental clicker game made with vanilla html/css/js where the units are Watts and the upgrades are various ways to generate energy.
